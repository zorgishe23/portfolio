            <p>About me/p> 
            <p></p> I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a doctor. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.
I got my Master's Degree from the Medical University of Odessa and have been a PhD fellow at the Kyiv University in ane of Shupik for 3 years. My research field was newborn pathology, which involved modelling of pathology through massively-parallel computing.
Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications and others.
I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a senior software tester in 1 year. In 5 years i want to be fully competent in AI, ML, DL.<p>
