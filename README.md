About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail due to my background as a research chemist. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Master's Degree from the University of Eastern Finland and have been a PhD fellow at the University of Jyväskylä for 3 years. My research field was computational physical chemistry, which involved modelling of chemical reactions through massively-parallel computing.

Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
